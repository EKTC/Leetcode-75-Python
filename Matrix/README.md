# 73. Set Matrix Zeroes

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/

- For the most optimal solution we can use the first row and first column to mark what rows we want to zero out
- Thus we also need to keep track if we need to zero out the first row and first column with a variable and a check
- We then zero out everything in the matrix
- A solution that would be more reasonable to think of in a time pinch is to initialise an array based on the number of columns and rows
- And then store if they need to be zeroed out or not
